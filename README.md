This repository contains my implementations of a **KD-Tree** in **C++**. 

Also included is my implementation of an **artificial neural network** for the Wheat Seeds Dataset, which predicts the species of wheat seed given seed measurements from different varieties of wheat. The tutorial I followed can be found here.
